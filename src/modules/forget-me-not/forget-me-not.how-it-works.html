  Forget Me Not places people into one or more of its predefined categories and then determines what to record about the person based on the settings for those categories.
</p>
<p>
  If a user falls into multiple categories, Forget Me Not will remember anything that's turned on for any of the categories. For instance, if a user has been both liked and bookmarked and Forget Me Not is configured to remember the basic details and profile text for bookmarks and to remember the basic details and questions for likes then it will remember all three types of things for that user.

  To prevent accidental loss of data, Forget Me Not will not automatically clean out old data when settings are changed or when a user is removed from a category. To prevent having stale data mixed with fresh data for a user, Forget Me Not will also continue to update any data that's still in its memory. Use the Memory Management section to manage everything that Forget Me Not remembers and to easily remove old data that should no longer be recorded.
